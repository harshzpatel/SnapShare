### Notable Files
- lib/services/chat_service.dart — Chat send/stream logic (chats/{chatId}/messages)
- lib/services/notification_service.dart — FCM registration, token storage, local notifications, deep-links
- lib/main.dart — App init, FCM background handler, navigation on notification
- functions/main.py — Firestore trigger to fan-out FCM notifications for new messages

## 🔔 How notifications work
- On app start, NotificationService requests permission, fetches FCM token, and stores it under users/{uid}/tokens/{token}
- When a message is sent, the Cloud Function looks up receiver tokens and sends a data-only FCM
- Foreground: app shows a styled local notification with the sender’s avatar
- Background/terminated: tapping the notification deep-links to ChatScreen
- If you’re already chatting with that user, notifications are suppressed
